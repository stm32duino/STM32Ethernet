# STM32 Ethernet Library for Arduino

With an STM32 board with Ethernet compatibility, this library allows a STM32
board (NUCLEO, DISCOVERY, ...) to connect to the internet.  

This library follows the Ethernet API from Arduino.<br>
For more information about it please visit: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet

## Dependency

This library is based on LwIP, a Lightweight TCP/IP stack, available here:

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/lwip.git

The LwIP has been ported as Arduino library and is available thanks Arduino Library Manager.

Source: https://github.com/stm32duino/LwIP

## Configuration

The LwIP has several user defined options, which is specified from within the `lwipopts.h` file.

This library provides a default user defined options file named `lwipopts_default.h`.

User can provide his own defined options at sketch level by adding his configuration in a file named `STM32lwipopts.h`.


## New alternative init procedure **!!!**

There are alternative inits of the Ethernetinterface with following orders:

	Ethernet.begin();
	Ethernet.begin(ip);
	Ethernet.begin(ip, subnet);
	Ethernet.begin(ip, subnet, gateway);
	Ethernet.begin(ip, subnet, gateway, dns);

This is more logical. A MAC address is no more needed and will retrieved internally by the mbed MAC address!

You can get the MAC address with following function, this must done after Ethernet.Begin()
	
	uint8_t *mac;
	Ethernet.begin();
	mac = Ethernet.macAddress();

You can also set a new user based MAC address, this must done before Ethernet.begin()

	uint8_t newMAC[] = {0x00, 0x80, 0xE1, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01};
	Ethernet.macAddress(newMAC);
	Ethernet.begin();

## Note

`EthernetClass::maintain()` in no more required to renew IP address from DHCP.<br>
It is done automatically by the LwIP stack in a background task.  

An Idle task is required by the LwIP stack to handle timer and data reception.<br>
This idle task is called inside a timer callback each 1 ms by the
function `stm32_eth_scheduler()`.<br>
A `DEFAULT_ETHERNET_TIMER` is set in the library to `TIM14`.<br>
`DEFAULT_ETHERNET_TIMER` can be redefined in the core variant.<br>
Be careful to not lock the system in a function which disabling IRQ.<br>
Call `Ethernet::schedule()` performs an update of the LwIP stack.<br>
